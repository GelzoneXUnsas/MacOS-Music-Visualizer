/** A circular, lock-free buffer for multiple channels of audio.
 
    Supports a single writer (producer) and any number of readers (consumers).
 
    Make sure that the number of samples read from the RingBuffer in every
    readSamples() call is less than the bufferSize specified in the constructor.
 
    Also, ensure that the number of samples read from the RingBuffer at any time
    plus the number of samples written to the RingBuffer at any time never exceed
    the buffer size. This prevents read/write overlap.
